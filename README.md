# Autonomous Object Sorting Project

### Overview
This project simulates a mobile robot using MATLAB's Robotics Playground and Stateflow. The robot autonomously sorts objects of different colors into designated zones within an enclosed arena.

### Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes sensors to detect colored objects and measure distances and angles.
- **Path Planning**: Implements algorithms to guide the robot towards objects and transport them to corresponding zones.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Integrates front and rear range sensors for safe navigation.
- **Stateflow Integration**: Employs a Stateflow chart for structured step-by-step control.

### Highlights
- Successfully sorted objects with 100% accuracy in trials.
- Adaptive handling of different color sequences and environmental setups.
- Robust error management and route adjustments for enhanced precision.

### Results
- Completed multiple trials with varied color configurations.
- Detailed runtime analysis and tuning to optimize the robot's performance.

### Team Contributions
- **Project Implementation**: Collaborative coding, testing, and documentation by Group R4.
- **Analysis & Tuning**: Extensive testing to fine-tune the algorithm for various scenarios.
